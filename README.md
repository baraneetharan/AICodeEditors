## 1. Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications. It consists of several phases, each of which can benefit from AI-driven tools, particularly AI code editors. The primary SDLC phases include:

- **Requirement Analysis**: Gathering and analyzing project requirements.
- **System Design**: Creating architectural and technical designs.
- **Implementation (Coding)**: Writing and testing code.
- **Testing**: Verifying and validating software functionality.
- **Deployment**: Releasing the software to production.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing support and updates.

AI code editors streamline these phases by automating repetitive tasks, providing intelligent suggestions, and enhancing collaboration.
